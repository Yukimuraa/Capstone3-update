# 🔧 Bus Dropdown Fix - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Removed Unnecessary Vehicle Types
**Problem:** Admin form showed Coaster, Van, Shuttle options  
**Solution:** Changed dropdown to only show "Bus" option  
**File:** `admin/bus.php`

### ✅ Issue 2: Bus 4 Not Showing in Student Dropdown
**Problem:** Student bus selection was hardcoded to only show Bus 1, 2, 3  
**Solution:** Made the dropdown dynamic - now loads ALL buses from database  
**File:** `student/bus.php`

---

## What Changed

### 1. Admin Panel (`admin/bus.php`)

**Before:**
```html
<select name="vehicle_type">
    <option value="">Select Type</option>
    <option value="Bus">Bus</option>
    <option value="Coaster">Coaster</option>
    <option value="Van">Van</option>
    <option value="Shuttle">Shuttle</option>
</select>
```

**After:**
```html
<select name="vehicle_type">
    <option value="Bus">Bus</option>
</select>
```

---

### 2. Student Panel (`student/bus.php`)

**Before (Hardcoded):**
```html
<select id="bus_no" name="bus_no">
    <option value="1">Bus 1</option>
    <option value="2">Bus 2</option>
    <option value="3">Bus 3</option>
</select>
```

**After (Dynamic):**
```php
<select id="bus_no" name="bus_no">
    <option value="">Select Bus</option>
    <?php foreach ($available_buses as $bus): ?>
        <option value="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($bus['bus_number']); ?>">
            Bus <?php echo htmlspecialchars($bus['bus_number']); ?> 
            (<?php echo htmlspecialchars($bus['vehicle_type']); ?> - <?php echo $bus['capacity']; ?> seats)
        </option>
    <?php endforeach; ?>
</select>
```

## How It Works Now

### For Students:

**When Creating a Bus Request:**
1. Open the "New Request" form
2. The "Bus Number" dropdown now shows:
   - Bus 1 (Bus - 50 seats)
   - Bus 2 (Bus - 50 seats)
   - Bus 3 (Bus - 50 seats)
   - **Bus 4 (Bus - 50 seats)** ← NOW VISIBLE!
   - ... and any other buses you add

3. Select a date and bus number
4. System checks availability in real-time
5. Submit the request

### For Admins:

**When Adding a New Bus:**
1. Go to Admin → Bus Management → Manage Buses
2. Fill the form:
   - Bus Number: 4
   - Vehicle Type: Bus (only option)
   - Capacity: 50
   - Status: Available
3. Click "Add Bus"
4. ✅ Bus 4 is now available for students to select!

## Technical Details

### Database Query Added
```php
// Get all available buses from database
$buses_query = "SELECT id, bus_number, vehicle_type, capacity, status 
                FROM buses 
                ORDER BY bus_number ASC";
$buses_result = $conn->query($buses_query);
$available_buses = [];
while ($bus = $buses_result->fetch_assoc()) {
    $available_buses[] = $bus;
}
```

### JavaScript Updated
- Removed hardcoded bus numbers `{ '1': true, '2': true, '3': true }`
- Now dynamically reads bus options from the dropdown
- Checks availability for ALL buses in the system
- Updates availability status in real-time

## Example Dropdown Display

**Student will now see:**
```
Bus Number *
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Select Bus                       ▼ │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Bus 1 (Bus - 50 seats)             │
│ Bus 2 (Bus - 50 seats)             │
│ Bus 3 (Bus - 50 seats)             │
│ Bus 4 (Bus - 50 seats)             │ ← NEW!
│ Bus 5 (Bus - 50 seats)             │ ← If added
│ ...                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

When a bus is booked on selected date:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Bus 1 (Bus - 50 seats)             │
│ Bus 2 (Bus - 50 seats) (Not avail) │ ← Disabled
│ Bus 3 (Bus - 50 seats)             │
│ Bus 4 (Bus - 50 seats)             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Future Enhancements

- ✨ Add different bus sizes (30 seats, 40 seats, 60 seats)
- ✨ Add special buses for specific routes
- ✨ Retire old buses (delete them)
- ✨ Show bus capacity in selection
- ✨ Filter buses by availability

---

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ If Bus 4 Still Not Showing:

**Check 1: Is Bus 4 in Database?**
```sql
SELECT * FROM buses WHERE bus_number = '4';
```

**Check 2: Clear Browser Cache**
- Press Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Or clear browser cache manually

**Check 3: Check Database Connection**
- Verify `config/database.php` is working
- Check for PHP errors in console

**Check 4: Verify Bus Status**
- Bus should have status (available, booked, maintenance, etc.)
- Any status will show in dropdown
