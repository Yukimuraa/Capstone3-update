║          BUS REJECTION NOT SHOWING TO STUDENT - FIXED ✅                  ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

PROBLEM:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
❌ Admin rejects a bus request
❌ Student still sees "Submitted" badge
❌ No indication the request was rejected
❌ Statistics show "Rejected: 0"

ROOT CAUSE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The student page was showing a HARDCODED "Submitted" badge for ALL requests,
regardless of their actual status in the database!

SOLUTION APPLIED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Fixed status badges to show ACTUAL status from database
✅ Added color-coding and icons for each status
✅ Fixed statistics to show real counts

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎨 STATUS BADGES NOW SHOW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⏰ [Pending]   - Yellow badge when waiting for approval
✅ [Approved]  - Green badge when approved
❌ [Rejected]  - Red badge when rejected ← NOW VISIBLE!
🏁 [Completed] - Blue badge when finished

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚡ QUICK TEST:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: As Admin
   → Go to: admin/bus.php
   → Find a pending request
   → Click the ❌ (reject) button

STEP 2: As Student  
   → Go to: student/bus.php
   → Find your request
   → Should now show: ❌ [Rejected] in RED! ✓

STEP 3: Check Statistics
   → Look at the stats cards at the top
   → Should show: Rejected: 1 (or actual count) ✓

📋 EXAMPLE - WHAT STUDENT SEES NOW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

BEFORE (Broken):
   📍 Bacolod       [Submitted]  ← Wrong! Shows "Submitted" for rejected
   
AFTER (Fixed):
   📍 Bacolod  ❌ [Rejected]      ← Correct! Shows actual status!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 STATISTICS NOW SHOW REAL COUNTS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

BEFORE:
   Total: 3 | Approved: 0 | Pending: 0 | Rejected: 0  ← All wrong!

AFTER:
   Total: 3 | Approved: 1 | Pending: 1 | Rejected: 1  ← Accurate! ✓

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT WAS CHANGED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

File: student/bus.php

Change 1 (Lines 720-756):
   ✅ Removed hardcoded "Submitted" badge
   ✅ Added dynamic status detection
   ✅ Added color coding & icons

Change 2 (Lines 568-580):
   ✅ Fixed statistics query
   ✅ Changed from hardcoded 0s to real counts
   ✅ Added user_id filter

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✨ SUMMARY:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Students can now see:
   ✅ When their request is rejected (RED badge with ❌)
   ✅ When their request is approved (GREEN badge with ✅)
   ✅ When their request is pending (YELLOW badge with ⏰)
   ✅ Accurate statistics for all statuses

Just refresh student/bus.php and rejected requests will appear! 🎉
