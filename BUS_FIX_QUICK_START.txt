║              BUS REQUEST NOT SHOWING - QUICK FIX                          ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

PROBLEM:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
❌ Student submits bus request → Admin sees 0 requests
❌ Admin page shows "No schedules found for this month"
❌ Request was "hidden" because admin page only showed current month

ROOT CAUSE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The admin page was filtering to ONLY show October 2025 requests.
If student requested a bus for November/December/any other month = HIDDEN!

SOLUTION APPLIED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Admin page NOW shows ALL requests by default
✅ Added filter buttons: "All Requests" | "Current Month"  
✅ No more hidden requests!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚡ QUICK TEST (2 STEPS):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: Run Diagnostic Tool
   👉 http://localhost/Capstone-3/check_bus_requests.php
   
   This will show:
   ✓ Total requests in database
   ✓ Requests grouped by month
   ✓ Requests grouped by status
   ✓ Complete list of all requests

STEP 2: Check Admin Page
   👉 http://localhost/Capstone-3/admin/bus.php
   
   You should now see:
   ✓ "Bus Management System (All Requests)"
   ✓ All pending bus requests
   ✓ Filter buttons at the top

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 WHAT'S NEW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FILTER BUTTONS (Top Right):

   [All Requests]  ← Shows ALL requests (DEFAULT - always use this!)
   [Current Month] ← Shows only October 2025

PAGE TITLE SHOWS:
   "Bus Management System (All Requests)" ← Default
   "Bus Management System (October 2025)" ← When filtered

STATISTICS NOW SHOW:
   Instead of: Total Requests: 0
   Now shows:  Total Requests: [actual count from all months]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 EXAMPLE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

BEFORE (October filter only):
   Available Buses: 5/5
   Total Requests: 0  ← Your November request was hidden!
   Pending: 0
   Approved: 0

AFTER (All Requests):
   Available Buses: 5/5
   Total Requests: 1  ← Now visible!
   Pending: 1         ← Your request appears!
   Approved: 0

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STILL SEEING 0 REQUESTS?

Option 1: Check if request was actually saved
   → Run: check_bus_requests.php
   → Look at "Total Bus Requests Found"
   → If 0 = request wasn't saved properly

Option 2: Check if buses exist
   → Run: check_bus_requests.php
   → Scroll to "Bus Inventory" section
   → If 0 buses = you need to add buses first

Option 3: Test by creating new request
   → Login as student
   → Go to Bus Schedule
   → Submit a new request
   → Refresh admin page
   → Should now appear!
