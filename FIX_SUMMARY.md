# Fix Summary: Database Table Missing Error

## Problem
You were getting this error:
```
Fatal error: Uncaught mysqli_sql_exception: Table 'chmsu_bao.user_accounts' doesn't exist
```

This happened because the database tables hadn't been created yet.

## Solution Implemented

I've created a complete database setup system for your CHMSU BAO project. Here's what was done:

### 1. Created SQL Schema Files
- ✅ `database/complete_database_setup.sql` - Complete database schema with all tables
- ✅ `database/user_accounts_tables.sql` - User accounts table schema
- ✅ Updated `database/bus_tables.sql` - Added missing bus_schedules table
- ✅ `database/calendar_tables.sql` - Already existed (facility bookings)

### 2. Created Setup Scripts
- ✅ `database/setup_complete.php` - Main setup script (creates all tables)
- ✅ `database/setup_user_accounts.php` - Creates user_accounts table only
- ✅ `database/index.php` - Visual setup interface with status checking
- ✅ `setup_database.php` - Quick access from root directory

### 3. Updated Existing Files
- ✅ `database/create_new_users.php` - Added 'organization' column support
- ✅ `database/bus_tables.sql` - Added bus_schedules table creation

### 4. Created Documentation
- ✅ `DATABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Detailed setup instructions
- ✅ `database/README.md` - Database folder documentation
- ✅ `test_database.php` - Database connection test tool

### 5. All Tables Created
The setup creates these tables:
1. **user_accounts** - User authentication (with organization field for external users)
2. **inventory** - Product inventory management
3. **orders** - Order tracking and management
4. **buses** - Bus fleet information
5. **bus_schedules** - Bus booking schedules
6. **bus_bookings** - Active bus bookings
7. **billing_statements** - Billing and receipts
8. **facilities** - Facility information (gym, courts, etc.)
9. **bookings** - Facility bookings
10. **requests** - General user requests

## How to Fix Your Issue

### STEP 1: Run the Setup
Choose one of these methods:

**Method A: Web Interface (Easiest)**
1. Make sure XAMPP is running (start Apache and MySQL)
2. Open your browser
3. Go to: `http://localhost/Capstone-3/database/index.php`
4. Click "Run Complete Setup"
5. Wait for "Setup Complete!" message

**Method B: Direct Setup**
1. Go to: `http://localhost/Capstone-3/database/setup_complete.php`
2. Wait for completion

**Method C: Quick Setup**
1. Go to: `http://localhost/Capstone-3/setup_database.php`

**Method D: Manual Import (phpMyAdmin)**
1. Open: `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
2. Select database: `chmsu_bao` (create it if needed)
3. Click "Import"
4. Select file: `database/complete_database_setup.sql`
5. Click "Go"

### STEP 2: Test the Fix
After running setup, test your database:
1. Go to: `http://localhost/Capstone-3/test_database.php`
2. Check that all tables show "✅ SUCCESS"

### STEP 3: Try Login/Register
Now you can use the system:
1. **Login**: `http://localhost/Capstone-3/login.php`
2. **Register**: `http://localhost/Capstone-3/register.php`

## Default Login Credentials

After setup, use these to test login (password for all: `admin123`):

| User Type | Email | Access Level |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| Admin | admin@chmsu.edu.ph | Full admin access |
| Staff | staff@chmsu.edu.ph | Admin/staff access |
| Student | student@chmsu.edu.ph | Student portal |
| External | external@example.com | External user portal |

## Sample Data Included

The setup includes sample data:
- ✅ 4 user accounts (admin, staff, student, external)
- ✅ 3 buses (Bus #1, #2, #3)
- ✅ 5 facilities (Gymnasium, Pool, Tennis Court, Basketball Court, Conference Room)
- ✅ 5 inventory items (T-Shirt, Mug, Notebook, Pen Set, USB Drive)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Connection failed"
**Solution:**
- Start MySQL in XAMPP Control Panel
- Check `config/database.php` has correct credentials

### Issue: "Table still doesn't exist" after setup
**Solution:**
1. Check setup completed without errors
2. Run `test_database.php` to verify
3. Check database name is `chmsu_bao` in `config/database.php`

### Issue: "Duplicate entry" warnings
**This is normal** - It means data already exists. The setup script is smart and won't duplicate data.

### Issue: Setup page doesn't load
**Solution:**
- Make sure Apache is running in XAMPP
- Check the URL path is correct
- Try accessing from root: `http://localhost/Capstone-3/`

## Security Notes

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** After setup, for production use:
1. Change all default passwords
2. Update sample email addresses
3. Remove or restrict access to setup scripts
4. Review user permissions

## What's Next?

After running the setup:
1. ✅ Test login with sample credentials
2. ✅ Test registration with a new account
3. ✅ Explore the different user dashboards
4. ✅ Change default passwords
5. ✅ Customize sample data as needed

## Need Help?

If you're still having issues:
1. Run `test_database.php` to diagnose the problem
2. Check XAMPP Control Panel - MySQL should be green/running
3. Check `config/database.php` for correct settings
4. Look at the error messages in setup scripts
5. Check MySQL error log in XAMPP

## Files You Can Delete Later

Once your system is working, you can optionally delete:
- `setup_database.php` (root directory)
- `test_database.php` (root directory)
- `FIX_SUMMARY.md` (this file)
- `DATABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

Keep the files in the `database/` folder for future reference or if you need to reset the database.

**Your system should now be fully functional! 🎉**
