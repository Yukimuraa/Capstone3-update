║            PHP WARNING FIXED - $view_filter                               ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

WARNING MESSAGE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Warning: Undefined variable $view_filter in admin/bus.php on line 88
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PROBLEM:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The variable $view_filter was being used in the page header (line 88)
BEFORE it was defined (line 146).

PHP reads code from top to bottom, so when it reached line 88, 
$view_filter didn't exist yet!

SOLUTION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Moved the variable definition to the TOP of the file (line 79-80)
✅ Removed the duplicate definition (was at line 145-146)
✅ Now $view_filter is available when the header needs it

WHAT WAS CHANGED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

admin/bus.php - Line 79-80 (ADDED):
   // Check if filter is set (default to "all" to show all requests)
   $view_filter = isset($_GET['view']) ? $_GET['view'] : 'all';

admin/bus.php - Line 145-146 (REMOVED - was duplicate):
   // Check if filter is set (default to "all" to show all requests)
   $view_filter = isset($_GET['view']) ? $_GET['view'] : 'all';

RESULT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Warning is gone!
✅ Page displays correctly
✅ Filter buttons work properly
✅ "(All Requests)" displays without errors

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TEST IT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Go to: http://localhost/Capstone-3/admin/bus.php
2. Should display: "Bus Management System (All Requests)"
3. No PHP warnings should appear!

✨ Fixed!
