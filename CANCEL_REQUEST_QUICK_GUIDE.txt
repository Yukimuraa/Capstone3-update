COMMON SCENARIOS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Scenario 1: CHANGED MIND
   "I submitted a request but realized I picked the wrong date"
   → Solution: Cancel the pending request and submit a new one ✓

Scenario 2: DUPLICATE REQUEST
   "I accidentally submitted the same request twice"
   → Solution: Cancel one of the duplicate pending requests ✓

Scenario 3: PLANS CHANGED
   "Our trip was postponed/cancelled"
   → Solution: Cancel the pending request to avoid admin work ✓

Scenario 4: WRONG INFORMATION
   "I entered wrong destination/details"
   → Solution: Cancel and submit a corrected request ✓

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TROUBLESHOOTING:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Q: I don't see a cancel button!
A: Cancel button only appears for PENDING requests. If your request is
   already approved, rejected, or completed, you cannot cancel it.

Q: I clicked cancel but nothing happened!
A: Make sure to click "OK" in the confirmation dialog. If you clicked
   "Cancel" in the dialog, the request won't be cancelled.

Q: Can I un-cancel a cancelled request?
A: No. Once cancelled, you need to submit a new request. Cancelled
   requests remain in history for record-keeping only.

Q: Admin already approved my request, can I cancel?
A: No. Once approved, the request is locked and cannot be cancelled.
   Contact the admin directly if you need to change it.
