1. Go to Admin → Bus Management → Manage Buses
2. Fill form: Bus #4, Type: Bus, Capacity: 50, Status: Available
3. Click Add Bus
4. Expected: Success message, bus appears in table

**Test duplicate bus number:**
1. Try adding bus #4 again
2. Expected: Error message "Bus number already exists"

**Test changing status:**
1. Click edit icon on a bus
2. Change status to "Maintenance"
3. Click Update Status
4. Expected: Success message, badge color changes

**Test deleting bus:**
